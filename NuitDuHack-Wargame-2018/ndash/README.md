# ndash

ndash was a 250-point Crypto challenge at **Nuit Du Hack 2018**. I was very surprised to see it has only been solved 8 times, since it was probably the easiest challenge I encountered (*disregarding icmp*). I believe we missed getting first blood by not opening the challenge quickly enough :). From what I gathered though, the solution presented here was **not intended**.

## Challenge description

Because we can't access the platform anymore, this challenge shall remain without description for now.
We know that we are supposed to read the **flag.txt** file in the folder where this script runs, and we are provided with a link to the following source:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3.6

        print("#"*40, flush=True)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Analyzing the source code

Our aim is obviously to reach the following part of code:

```python
with open(os.path.normpath(file_to_read)) as f:
	print("File content is:", flush=True)
	print("#"*40, flush=True)
	print(f.read(), flush=True)
	print("#"*40, flush=True)
```

with `os.path.normpath(file_to_read)` somehow being equivalent to `./flag.txt`.
 
This essentially means that we have to avoid this block of code:

```python
if safe_path_hash != file_to_read_hash:
	print("Sorry, you are not allowed to read this file", flush=True)
	exit(0)
```

This means that `safe_path_hash` and `file_to_read_hash` must be equal.

```python
# Compute the hash of the file names
safe_path_hash = myhash.NDHash(safe_path_user)
file_to_read_hash = myhash.NDHash(file_to_read)
```

Both hashes are computed using a custom hash function which we don't seem to have the code for (*spoiler: we can actually get the code, but we did not even try*).

`safe_path_user` and `file_to_read` are two strings that we can control, one of which (*safe_path_user*) is passed through a sanitizing function as seen below:

```python
safe_path_user = input("Enter the only safe file there is: ")
file_to_read = input("Enter the file you want to read: ")
check_is_safe(safe_path_user)

print(f"Trying safe_path_user={safe_path_user} and file_to_read={file_to_read}", file=sys.stderr)

# Compute the hash of the file names
safe_path_hash = myhash.NDHash(safe_path_user)
file_to_read_hash = myhash.NDHash(file_to_read)
```

Let's add comments to the sanitizing code:

```python
# Basically truncates a string to its first f_namemax characters, and checks that the resulting file exists
def sanitize(path: str) -> str:
    path = path[:os.statvfs(".").f_namemax] # truncating to f_namemax characters
    print(path)
    assert os.path.isfile(path) # Checking that path still points to a valid file
    return path

# Sanitizes the path using the above function and then checks that the resulting path points to './hello_world.txt'
def check_is_safe(user_path: str):
    path = sanitize(user_path) # Sanitizes the path
    assert pathlib.PurePath(path) == pathlib.PurePath("./hello_world.txt") # Checks that it points to './hello_world.txt'
```

So, it seems we're left with two options to get the flag:

1. find the hashing function source and **create a hash collision between the file we want to request and the sanitized path**;
2. work from what we have and **exploit the sanitizing function**.

We decided to go with **2**, because `check_is_safe` is doing something very wrong: it does not return the sanitized path after checking it. This means that as long as we're able to modify our path in a meaningful way after the first `f_namemax` characters and to pad it correctly so that the first `f_namemax` characters correspond to a path semantically equal to `./hello_world.txt`, we can pretty much pass any path we want. **Path truncation + directory traversal**, it is!

If we set both variables to this path, we'll be able to **pass the sanitizing function** as well as the subsequent condition, as we'll be **comparing the hash of a string with itself**.

On my Debian system, `os.statvfs(".").f_namemax` is a constant equal to **255**. We can assume it is probably the same on the remote server. Therefore, a valid payload would be:

```python
payload = "././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././hello_world.txt/../flag.txt"
```

We connect to the service, send this twice andâ€¦ **Flagged!**

**Flag: ndh16_793a07af2612eb79254e2f22ce25ccac8d3698cac05ea25ec6f6a2c66eca8802959ab77e2a29c177437ab8ebd0a681834429197b6a5acf654d0a1de83b6dae65**

## Wrapping up

This challenge was easy, but amusing. I think that the "correct" solution actually involves a hash collision. Nevertheless, I am quite disappointed that this was the **only challenge tagged as "cryptography"** and that it **didn't actually require any of that**.
